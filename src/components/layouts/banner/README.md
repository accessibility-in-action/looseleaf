# Banner

The banner (a `<header>` with a `role` attribute of [`banner`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/banner.html))
is styled with a width of 100% and should contain a [wrapper](/components/detail/wrapper)
as its direct descendant. In practical use, the banner might contain
the site title and primary navigation.

# Main

The [main content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/contentinfo.html)
is styled with a width of 100% and should contain a [wrapper](/components/detail/wrapper)
as its direct descendant. The main element should also have an `id` attribute of
`main` to support a ["skip to content" link](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-skip-to-content-link/).

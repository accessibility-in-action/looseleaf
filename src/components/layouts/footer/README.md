# Footer

The footer (a `<footer>` with a `role` attribute of [`contentinfo`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/contentinfo.html))
is styled with a width of 100% and should contain a [wrapper](/components/detail/wrapper)
as its direct descendant. In practical use, the footer might contain
the site license and contact information.

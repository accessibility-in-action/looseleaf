# Aside

The aside (an `<aside>` element with a `role` attribute of [`complementary`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/complementary.html))
is displayed above the [main](/components/detail/main/) element on mobile
devices and as a left sidebar on large tablets and desktop devices. In practical
usage, the aside may contain a secondary navigation (a page's table of contents)
or other supporting content which remains meaningful without the main content.

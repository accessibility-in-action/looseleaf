# Select

Select elements are styled using `appearance: none` and a custom SVG icon added
via a background image. For further customization, see [custom properties](/docs/custom-properties/).

Labels and the corresponding select element are intended to be wrapped in a
containing element of some sort, ideally a paragraph.

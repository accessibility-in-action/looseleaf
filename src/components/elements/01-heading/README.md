# Heading

Heading styles are applied to headings level one through four (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`,
and `<h4>`). When headings appear within a [`.flow` container](http://localhost:3000/components/detail/flow),
they will have a 1em block start (top) margin, which is proportional to the
heading font size.

Only four levels are provided. If a page needs more than four heading levels, it
should likely be split up into several more concise pages.

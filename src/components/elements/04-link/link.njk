<p>Sometimes, a link <a href="#">appears within a paragraph</a> like that one just did. Other times, a link appears on a line by itself without any surrounding text:</p>

<p><a href="#">Continue</a></p>

<p>This is <a href="/components/preview/link" aria-current="page">a link</a> to the current page, rather than to a different page. It has the appropriate <code>aria-current="page"</code> attribute.

<p>This is a button-style link: <a class="button" href="#">Cancel</a></p>

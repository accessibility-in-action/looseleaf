# Blockquote

Blockquotes can include a citation, which should be wrapped in a [`<cite>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite).
The em dash that precedes a citation is added using generated content, so only
the name or work cited needs to be include within the `<cite>` element.

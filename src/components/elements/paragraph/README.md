# Paragraph

Paragraphs use the base font size, which is a [fluid range](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/?c=320,20,1.2,1140,24,1.25,5,4)
between 20 and 24 pixels. When headings appear within a [`.flow` container](http://localhost:3000/components/detail/flow),
they will have a 1em block start (top) margin, proportional to the paragraph
font size.

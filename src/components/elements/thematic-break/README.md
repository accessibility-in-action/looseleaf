# Thematic Break

The [`<hr>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) element
represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a
change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section. An `<hr>` is
displayed as an [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(typography))
using CSS [generated content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto/Generated_content).

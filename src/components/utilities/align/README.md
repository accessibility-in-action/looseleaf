# Align

The `.align-start`, `.align-center`, and `.align-end` classes apply alignment to
a container based on [CSS logical
properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties).
For left-to-right languages such as English and French, `start` corresponds to
`left` and `end` corresponds to `right`. For right-to-left languages such aspect
Arabic and Hebrew, `start` corresponds to `right` and `end` corresponds to `left`.
